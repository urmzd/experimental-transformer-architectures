# AGI Models

Exploring what computation *actually is* — not copying the brain's structure, but finding the simplest mathematical substrate that produces intelligence.

## Philosophy

### 1. The medium is not the message
Everyone in ML copies the brain's **structure**: neurons → hidden units, synapses → weights, cortical layers → transformer layers. This is like trying to fly by building mechanical feathers. We don't copy structure — we look for the **underlying dynamics** that produce intelligent behavior, regardless of substrate.

### 2. Registers are words
Standard transformers map tokens into opaque embedding spaces where intermediate states are uninterpretable. Our models keep computation in **vocabulary space** — every intermediate state is readable as "which words are active and how strongly." Interpretability by construction, not by post-hoc analysis.

```
Input:  one-hot("cat") → R["cat"] = 1.0, all else 0.0
State:  always a distribution over words
Output: register state IS the prediction — no output projection needed
```

### 3. Simple math, composed deeply
Dot products, outer products, dense projections, relu. If the math didn't exist before 1980, we probably don't need it. The power comes from **composition and scale**, not mathematical complexity. This is why attention works — it's just a weighted average. And it's why Fourier projections failed us — too clever, not enough capacity.

### 4. Meta-learning over memorization
The trained weights define **how to learn**. The runtime state (Q-table, associative memory, policy) stores **what was learned** from the current sequence. The model learns during inference — like a Q-table in reinforcement learning that starts empty and fills up through experience.

### 5. Policy over lookup
Instead of memorizing every possible relationship (like attention's Q·K^T over all positions), learn a compact **policy** that decides what to do given the current state. The same mechanism can execute different operations on different inputs — data-dependent branching, not fixed computation.

## What we've learned

**Fourier projections don't work for cross-position mixing.** v3, v5, v6 all used Fourier-parameterized projections (rank-32 bottleneck) for Q/K/V. All produced flat loss. The bottleneck can't capture the complexity of word relationships.

**Dense projections work.** v1 (attention with dense matrices) and v9 (Q-table with dense projections) both learn. The key ingredient is full-rank learned projection matrices.

**Phase transitions are real.** v9 plateaued for 150 steps then loss dropped sharply from 6.30 → 5.60 in 80 steps. Don't kill runs during plateaus — the model may be coordinating internal representations before a breakthrough.

**101K params can learn language structure.** v4 reached val_bpb 3.65 with only 101K parameters (419KB compressed). Not competitive yet, but proves the architectural ideas have merit at extreme compression.

**Hard routing beats soft blending.** Soft mixtures of operations produce average behavior. Hard winner-take-all routing (Gumbel-softmax) produces conditional behavior — "if state looks like X, do op 3" — which is a fundamentally different computational primitive and compresses better (near-one-hot weights eat INT8+zlib for breakfast).

**Language needs multiple temporal scales.** A single decay rate forces the model to choose one timescale. Multiple Q-tables with different decays (fast γ≈0.5, medium γ≈0.95, slow γ≈0.99) capture bigram, paragraph, and document-level patterns simultaneously.

### Evolution of ideas

```
v0-v1:  Can registers = words?              → Yes, with attention (v1 best bpb)
v2:     Can convolutions replace attention?  → No (too slow, no cross-word mixing)
v3-v6:  Can Fourier projections replace      → No (rank bottleneck kills learning)
        dense matrices?
v4:     How small can we go?                 → 101K params, 419KB, val_bpb 3.65
v7:     Can we learn a program?              → Op bank + soft register addressing
v8:     Direct word-to-word graph?           → V×V interaction, multi-hop reasoning
v9:     Q-table with dense projections?      → Yes! Phase transition, val_bpb 3.32
v10:    Policy instead of lookup?            → State-dependent READ→OP→WRITE
v11a:   Oscillatory primitives?              → 5 brain wave ops, sequential composition
v11b:   Neural TPG (hard routing + depth)?   → Gumbel routing, 3 timescales, early exit
v12:    Sparse register addressing?          → Top-k subspace ops, full-rank in subspace
